### Contributing

GitFeats can always use some extra attention. If you are thinking of adding a feature, refactoring some horrendous code, fixing a bug or writing some tests, have at it.

I reccomend the following:

* Fork the project.
* Make a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature_branch`
* Make your changes.
* Add tests.
* Send a pull request.

If you are stuck on something, like adding tests, open a pull request anyways. I'm always more than happy to help.
